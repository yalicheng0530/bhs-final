 Installation Instructions For Local Development with WordPress

 1. Clone Repo 
    
    https://github.com/yalicheng0530/final-bhs/wp-content/themes/yl-bhs/.git

2. Install WP-CLI

Install WP-CLI so you can install WordPress from the Terminal. You should have this installed. If not, read the [wp-cli.md](https://github.com/kingluddite/web-dev-notes/blob/master/wordpress/wp-cli.md)

3. Install WordPress Core

```
$ wp core download
```

That will install WordPress core but you will still have your wp-content folder with your themes folder nested inside and with your custom theme nested inside the themes folder.

4. Start MAMP

Make sure your local server and mysql are running. For this example I'll assume you are using MAMP. Make sure Apache and MySQL are running.

* I like to change my DocumentRoot to `~/Sites`
* I like to remove port `8888` and use default http port so I only have to use `localhost` instead of ``localhost:8888``

5. Create Empty Database

Use MAMP's phpMyAdmin to create an empty database.

* please use underscores and not dashes when naming your database.
    - my-database-name (bad database name)
    - my_database_name (good database name)

WordPress will use this database for it's installation.

6. Create wp-config.php

Use WP-CLI to create your wp-config.php.

This is your important WordPress configuration file with your database connection information (and other important configuration settings).

```
$ wp core config --dbuser=root --dbpass=root --dbname=your_db_name
```

**note:** For MAMP the default user and password is `root`
Make sure to change the database name to the name of your empty database you just created using phpMyAdmin.

7. Finish up WordPress Install

```
$ wp core install --url=http://localhost/folder-name-here --title=YourSiteNameNoSpaces --admin_user=admin --admin_password=password --admin_email=youremail@someemail.com
```

This will create the tables and content of your WordPress install.
* I use `admin` as default user login
* I use `password` as default user password
* Make sure the folder you cloned from github is inside the `Sites` folder and you add this folder name to the end of `http://localhost/PUTHERE`

8. Change Theme

Change theme to your custom WordPress theme.

```
$ wp theme activate your-theme-name-here
```

9. Create Sublime Text Project file

Create a project file in Sublime Text that will enable you to see both the Core WordPress files and the custom theme.

10. Remove themes

See if you can remove the twentyfifteen and twentyfourteen themes using WP-ClI

11. Add Plugins

See if you can install and active a plugin using WP-CLI

12. Install Project Dependencies

Browse to your custom theme folder and type this in your Terminal

```
$ npm install
```

That should install all the dependencies we have listed in our custom theme's `package.json` file (we just have `bootstrap`).
